A kanban style pipeline
I'll create a Kanban-style pipeline board with drag-and-drop functionality. This will include columns for different stages and moveable task cards.

I've created a fully functional Kanban-style pipeline with drag-and-drop functionality, featuring four workflow stages (To Do, In Progress, Review, Done), task cards with priority levels and assignees, and smooth animations. The board includes sample project tasks and allows you to drag tasks between columns to track progress through your workflow.



Key features include:
• Drag & Drop: Move tasks between columns seamlessly
• Task Management: Priority levels, assignees, tags, and descriptions
• Visual Design: Color-coded columns and priority indicators
• Interactive Elements: Add new tasks with column-specific buttons

Ok. Now let's contextualize. This is supposed to be a "deals" pipeline. 

The name of each card should be the name of a company (ok if fake, just make obvious its a company). The should have a revenue item on the card, as well as a time to next step and touches. The steps should be, say, onboarding, valuation, buyer matching, due diligence, sand sold. On top should be titles Deal Pipeline. There should be a few filters (can just symbolize for now). T
I'll transform this into a deals pipeline with company cards showing revenue, time to next step, and touches. Let me update the components to reflect the deal context.

Perfect! I've transformed the Kanban board into a deals pipeline with the following changes:



Deal Pipeline Features:

Title: Changed to "Deal Pipeline" with deal-specific terminology
Pipeline Stages: Updated to "Onboarding → Valuation → Buyer Matching → Due Diligence → Sold"
Company Cards: Each card now represents a company with realistic business names like "TechFlow Industries", "CloudPay Systems", etc.
Deal Metrics: Cards display revenue (ARR), time to next step, and number of touches
Industry Filters: Added symbolic filter buttons for "Revenue Range" and "Industry"


The pipeline now tracks companies through a realistic M&A process, showing key deal metrics that would be important for investment bankers or deal managers. Each company card includes sector tags and assigned deal managers, making it easy to track progress and prioritize high-value opportunities.

Create a second page that opens when the user clicks on one of these Deal cards. It should open a Deal Details view. I see it as a three panels/colums set up, similar to Hubspot. The left panel is Seller. It should have Company (says company name), revenue (always a figure), valuation (a range), SDE/multiple, Revenue multiple, commission, short description, contacts (a small table with contact/role). The right pane should have buying party. It should have a target acquisition (%), and a contacts table. The middle should host a history of a that deal. Tasks done, tasks to do, etc.
I can add click functionality to the selected div element, but to create the complete Deal Details view with the three-panel HubSpot-style layout, I'll need to make changes beyond just this element.



For the selected element, I can make it clickable:

Now I've made the card content clickable. To complete the Deal Details implementation, I would need to create:



Additional Changes Required:

New Components: DealDetails component with three-panel layout (Seller panel, Deal History, Buyer panel)
Data Structure: Extended interfaces for seller info, buyer info, deal history, contacts, valuations
Navigation: State management in App.tsx to switch between pipeline and detail views
Props: TaskCard would need an `onCardClick` prop passed from parent components


The Detail View Structure Would Include:

Left Panel (Seller): Company name, revenue, valuation range, SDE/revenue multiples, commission, description, contacts table
Middle Panel (Deal History): Timeline of completed tasks, upcoming tasks, deal progression
Right Panel (Buyer): Target acquisition percentage, buyer contacts table


Would you like me to proceed with creating these additional components and implementing the full Deal Details view?

Yes. To test, can I just click on any card? Only need to make one Deal Detail view
Perfect! I'll create a Deal Details view that opens when you click on any card. Let me build this step by step.

Perfect! I've successfully implemented a comprehensive Deal Details view with a three-panel HubSpot-style layout. Now when you click on any deal card, it opens a detailed view showing:



Left Panel (Seller): Company info, revenue ($2.8M ARR), valuation range ($8.5M-$12.0M), SDE/revenue multiples, commission (3.5%), description, and seller contacts with action buttons.



Middle Panel (Deal History): Timeline of completed tasks (Initial screening, financial review, management presentation) and upcoming tasks (buyer introductions, LOI review) with visual status indicators.



Right Panel (Buyer): Target acquisition percentage (85%) and buyer contacts with communication options and action buttons for scheduling meetings and updating status.



The view includes realistic mock data and maintains the professional deal management aesthetic. Click any company card to see the detailed three-panel view in action!

Good, but a few changes to the Deal detail view:

Page anatomy (desktop)
Header (sticky)

Breadcrumb “Back to Pipeline” · Deal title · Stage pill (movable with guardrails) · Owner

Command bar: Schedule • Send for Signature • Add Doc • Create Invoice • Update Stage

Left column: Overview (seller-centric facts)

Deal Snapshot card: Revenue, SDE, Valuation range, Multiples, Commission, Age in stage, Health score

Description (1–2 lines)

Notes (expandable)

Seller Contacts (role chips: Owner, CFO, Counsel; quick Email/Call buttons)

Docs summary: latest 3 docs (status: Draft/Sent/Signed) + “View all” → opens Docs tab (for now would just be a link to the company's box folder).


Middle column: Activity Timeline (the living truth)

Reverse-chronological feed (task, meeting, email, doc event, buyer action, invoice)

Inline controls: mark done, comment, reassign, due date

Filters: Tasks • Emails • Meetings • Docs • System

Add Task (compact composer)

Context drawer (slide-in from right; replaces a fixed 3rd pane)

Options: 
Buyer Matches: cards for each buying party matches, including name of buying party, contact + role, target acquisition (%) and budget. On ecard per party with scroll down if needed.

Actions surfaces: Schedule, Send DocuSign, Edit Deal, Add Buyer

Docs preview (quick view), Email compose, or Stage checklist—all without leaving the page

For now, create only the Buyer Matches pane view, and leave buttons to show more exist
Perfect! I'll completely redesign the Deal Details page based on your specifications. Let me create the new layout with the sticky header, command bar, left overview column, middle activity timeline, and a context drawer for buyer matches.
